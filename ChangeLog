     Add support for certificate key types for users and hosts.
     
     OpenSSH certificate key types are not X.509 certificates, but a much
     simpler format that encodes a public key, identity information and
     some validity constraints and signs it with a CA key. CA keys are
     regular SSH keys. This certificate style avoids the attack surface
     of X.509 certificates and is very easy to deploy.
     
     Certified host keys allow automatic acceptance of new host keys
     when a CA certificate is marked as trusted in ~/.ssh/known_hosts.
     see VERIFYING HOST KEYS in ssh(1) for details.
     
     Certified user keys allow authentication of users when the signing
     CA key is marked as trusted in authorized_keys. See "AUTHORIZED_KEYS
     FILE FORMAT" in sshd(8) for details.
     
     Certificates are minted using ssh-keygen(1), documentation is in
     the "CERTIFICATES" section of that manpage.
     
     Documentation on the format of certificates is in the file

     [mux.c]
     fix bug introduced in mux rewrite:
     
     In a mux master, when a socket to a mux slave closes before its server
     session (as may occur when the slave has been signalled), gracefully
     close the server session rather than deleting its channel immediately.
     A server may have more messages on that channel to send (e.g. an exit
     message) that will fatal() the client if they are sent to a channel that
     has been prematurely deleted.

     [channels.c channels.h clientloop.c clientloop.h mux.c nchan.c ssh.c]
     rewrite ssh(1) multiplexing code to a more sensible protocol.
     
     The new multiplexing code uses channels for the listener and
     accepted control sockets to make the mux master non-blocking, so
     no stalls when processing messages from a slave.
     
     avoid use of fatal() in mux master protocol parsing so an errant slave
     process cannot take down a running master.
     
     implement requesting of port-forwards over multiplexed sessions. Any
     port forwards requested by the slave are added to those the master has
     established.
     
     add support for stdio forwarding ("ssh -W host:port ...") in mux slaves.
     
     document master/slave mux protocol so that other tools can use it to
     control a running ssh(1). Note: there are no guarantees that this
     protocol won't be incompatibly changed (though it is versioned).

     [sftp.c]
     Implement tab-completion of commands, local and remote filenames for sftp.
     Hacked on and off for some time by myself, mouring, Carlos Silva (via 2009
     Google Summer of Code) and polished to a fine sheen by myself again.
     It should deal more-or-less correctly with the ikky corner-cases presented
     by quoted filenames, but the UI could still be slightly improved.
     In particular, it is quite slow for remote completion on large directories.

   set ownership and modes, so avoid explicitly setting them
 - (djm) [configure.ac loginrec.c] bz#1421: fix lastlog support for OSX.
   OSX provides a getlastlogxbyname function that automates the reading of
   a lastlog file. Also, the pututxline function will update lastlog so
   there is no need for loginrec.c to do it explicitly. Collapse some
   overly verbose code while I'm in there.

 - (tim) [contrib/cygwin/ssh-host-config] Whitespace cleanup. No code changes.

20090128
 - (tim) [contrib/cygwin/ssh-host-config] Patch from Corinna Vinschen.
   Changes to work on Cygwin 1.5.x as well as on the new Cygwin 1.7.x.
   The information given for the setting of the CYGWIN environment variable
   is wrong for both releases so I just removed it, together with the
   unnecessary (Cygwin 1.5.x) or wrong (Cygwin 1.7.x) default setting.

     [Makefile.in]
     Add support for an experimental zero-knowledge password authentication
     method using the J-PAKE protocol described in F. Hao, P. Ryan,
     "Password Authenticated Key Exchange by Juggling", 16th Workshop on
     Security Protocols, Cambridge, April 2008.
     
     This method allows password-based authentication without exposing
     the password to the server. Instead, the client and server exchange
     cryptographic proofs to demonstrate of knowledge of the password while
     revealing nothing useful to an attacker or compromised endpoint.
     
     This is experimental, work-in-progress code and is presently
     compiled-time disabled (turn on -DJPAKE in Makefile.inc).

     because parse_forward() is now used to parse all forward types (DLR),
     and it malloc's space for host variables, we don't need to malloc
     here.  fixes small memory leaks.
     
     previously dynamic forwards were not parsed in parse_forward() and
     space was not malloc'd in that case.

     [auth2-none.c auth2.c]
     Make protocol 2 MaxAuthTries behaviour a little more sensible:
     Check whether client has exceeded MaxAuthTries before running
     an authentication method and skip it if they have, previously it
     would always allow one try (for "none" auth).
     Preincrement failure count before post-auth test - previously this
     checked and postincremented, also to allow one "none" try.
     Together, these two changes always count the "none" auth method
     which could be skipped by a malicious client (e.g. an SSH worm)
     to get an extra attempt at a real auth method. They also make
     MaxAuthTries=0 a useful way to block users entirely (esp. in a
     sshd_config Match block).
     Also, move sending of any preauth banner from "none" auth method
     to the first call to input_userauth_request(), so worms that skip
     the "none" method get to see it too.

     Introduce SSH Fingerprint ASCII Visualization, a technique inspired by the
     graphical hash visualization schemes known as "random art", and by
     Dan Kaminsky's musings on the subject during a BlackOp talk at the
     23C3 in Berlin.
     Scientific publication (original paper):
     "Hash Visualization: a New Technique to improve Real-World Security",
     Perrig A. and Song D., 1999, International Workshop on Cryptographic
     Techniques and E-Commerce (CrypTEC '99)
     http://sparrow.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/projects/validation/validation.pdf
     The algorithm used here is a worm crawling over a discrete plane,
     leaving a trace (augmenting the field) everywhere it goes.
     Movement is taken from dgst_raw 2bit-wise.  Bumping into walls
     makes the respective movement vector be ignored for this turn,
     thus switching to the other color of the chessboard.
     Graphs are not unambiguous for now, because circles in graphs can be
     walked in either direction.

     deraadt@ djm@
     djm belives that the reason for the "0" strings is to ensure that
     it's not possible to call getaddrinfo with both host and port being
     NULL.  In the case of canohost.c host is a local array.  In the
     case of sshconnect.c, it's checked for null immediately before use.
     In dns.c it ultimately comes from ssh.c:main() and is guaranteed to
     be non-null but it's not obvious, so I added a warning message in
     case it is ever passed a null.

     [ssh.c sshd.c]
     Implement a channel success/failure status confirmation callback
     mechanism. Each channel maintains a queue of callbacks, which will
     be drained in order (RFC4253 guarantees confirm messages are not
     reordered within an channel).
     Also includes a abandonment callback to clean up if a channel is
     closed without sending confirmation messages. This probably
     shouldn't happen in compliant implementations, but it could be
     abused to leak memory.

     [sshd_config sshd_config.5]
     Make the maximum number of sessions run-time controllable via
     a sshd_config MaxSessions knob. This is useful for disabling
     login/shell/subsystem access while leaving port-forwarding working
     (MaxSessions 0), disabling connection multiplexing (MaxSessions 1) or
     simply increasing the number of allows multiplexed sessions.
     Because some bozos are sure to configure MaxSessions in excess of the
     number of available file descriptors in sshd (which, at peak, might be
     as many as 9*MaxSessions), audit sshd to ensure that it doesn't leak fds
     on error paths, and make it fail gracefully on out-of-fd conditions -
     sending channel errors instead of than exiting with fatal().

     [clientloop.c clientloop.h ssh.c]
     Use new channel status confirmation callback system to properly deal
     with "important" channel requests that fail, in particular command exec,
     shell and subsystem requests. Previously we would optimistically assume
     that the requests would always succeed, which could cause hangs if they
     did not (e.g. when the server runs out of fds) or were unimplemented by
     the server (bz #1384)
     Also, properly report failing multiplex channel requests via the mux
     client stderr (subject to LogLevel in the mux master) - better than
     silently failing.
