This is a Linux port of OpenBSD's excellent OpenSSH.

OpenSSH is based on the last free version of Tatu Ylonen's SSH with
all patent-encumbered algorithms removed, all known security bugs
fixed, new features reintroduced and many other clean-ups.

This Linux port basically consists of a few fixes to deal with
the way that OpenSSL is usually installed on Linux systems, a few
replacements for OpenBSD library functions and the introduction of PAM
support. This version tracks changes made to the OpenBSD CVS version.

The PAM support is now more functional than the popular packages of
commercial ssh-1.2.x. It checks "account" and "session" modules for
all logins, not just when using password authentication. This code is
very new and needs further testing.

All new code is released under a XFree style license, which is very
liberal. Please refer to the source files for details. The code in
strlcpy.c and mktemp.c is from the OpenBSD project and has its own
license (again, see source file for details).

OpenSSH depends on Zlib[1], OpenSSL[2] and optionally PAM[3]. To build
the GNOME[1] passphrase requestor (--with-gnome-askpass), you will
need the GNOME libraries installed.

To build OpenSSH, use the configure script provided. For example:

./configure --prefix=/opt/openssh
make
make install

Will install the OpenSSH binaries in /opt/openssh/bin, the 
configuration files in /opt/openssh/etc, and so forth.

This version of SSH is based upon code retrieved from the OpenBSD CVS
repository on 1999-11-09 which in turn was based on the last free 
version of SSH released by Tatu Ylonen.
