******* IMPORTANT
* On systmes which lack a /dev/random driver, this port of
* OpenSSH-1.2.2 was not correctly seeding OpenSSL's random number
* pool. This resulted in lower quality RSA keys being generated. If
* you generated host or user keys with v1.2.2, please generate new
* ones using a more recent version.

This is the port of OpenBSD's excellent OpenSSH to Linux and other
Unices.

OpenSSH is based on the last free version of Tatu Ylonen's SSH with
all patent-encumbered algorithms removed (to external libraries), all
known security bugs fixed, new features reintroduced and many other
clean-ups. More information about SSH itself can be found in the file
README.Ylonen. OpenSSH has been created by Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck,
Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt, and Dug Song. It has a
homepage at http://www.openssh.com/

This port consists of the re-introduction of autoconf support, PAM
support (for Linux and Solaris), EGD[1] support, SOCKS support (using
the Dante [6] libraries and replacements for OpenBSD library functions
that are (regrettably) absent from other unices. This port has been
best tested on Linux, Solaris, HPUX, NetBSD and Irix. Support for AIX,
SCO, NeXT and other Unices is underway. This version actively tracks
changes in the OpenBSD CVS repository.

The PAM support is now more functional than the popular packages of
commercial ssh-1.2.x. It checks "account" and "session" modules for
all logins, not just when using password authentication.

OpenSSH depends on Zlib[2], OpenSSL[3] and optionally PAM[4] and
Dante[6]. To build the GNOME[5] pass-phrase requester
(--with-gnome-askpass), you will need the GNOME libraries installed.

There is now several mailing lists for this port of OpenSSH. Please
refer to http://violet.ibs.com.au/openssh/list.html for details on how
to join.

Please send bug reports and patches to the mailing list
openssh-unix-dev@mindrot.org. The list is currently open to posting by
unsubscribed users.

Please refer to the INSTALL document for information on how to install
OpenSSH on your system. The UPGRADING document details differences 
between this port of OpenSSH and F-Secure SSH 1.x.

Miscellania - 

This version of SSH is based upon code retrieved from the OpenBSD CVS
repository which in turn was based on the last free 
version of SSH released by Tatu Ylonen.
