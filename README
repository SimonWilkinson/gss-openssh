This is the port of OpenBSD's excellent OpenSSH[0] to Linux and other
Unices.

OpenSSH is based on the last free version of Tatu Ylonen's SSH with
all patent-encumbered algorithms removed (to external libraries), all
known security bugs fixed, new features reintroduced and many other
clean-ups. More information about SSH itself can be found in the file
README.Ylonen. OpenSSH has been created by Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck,
Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt, and Dug Song. It has a
homepage at http://www.openssh.com/

This port consists of the re-introduction of autoconf support, PAM
support (for Linux and Solaris), EGD[1]/PRNGD[2] support and replacements 
for OpenBSD library functions that are (regrettably) absent from other 
unices. This port has been best tested on Linux, Solaris, HPUX, NetBSD 
and Irix. Support for AIX, SCO, NeXT and other Unices is underway. 
This version actively tracks changes in the OpenBSD CVS repository.

The PAM support is now more functional than the popular packages of
commercial ssh-1.2.x. It checks "account" and "session" modules for
all logins, not just when using password authentication.

OpenSSH depends on Zlib[3], OpenSSL[4] and optionally PAM[5].

There is now several mailing lists for this port of OpenSSH. Please
refer to http://www.openssh.com/list.html for details on how to join.

Please send bug reports and patches to the mailing list
openssh-unix-dev@mindrot.org. The list is open to posting by
unsubscribed users.

If you are a citizen of the USA or another country which restricts 
export of cryptographic products, then please refrain from sending 
crypto-related code or patches to the list. We cannot accept them.
Other code contribution are accepted, but please follow the OpenBSD
style guidelines[6].

Please refer to the INSTALL document for information on how to install
OpenSSH on your system. There are a number of differences between this 
port of OpenSSH and F-Secure SSH 1.x, please refer to the OpenSSH FAQ[7]
for details and general tips.

Miscellania - 

This version of SSH is based upon code retrieved from the OpenBSD CVS
repository which in turn was based on the last free 
version of SSH released by Tatu Ylonen.
