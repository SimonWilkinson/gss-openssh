This is a Linux port of OpenBSD's excellent OpenSSH. 

OpenSSH is based on the last free version of Tatu Ylonen's SSH with
all patent-encumbered algorithms removed, all known security bugs
fixed, new features reintroduced and many other clean-ups.

This Linux port basically consists of a few fixes to deal with the way
that OpenSSL is usually installed on Linux systems, a few replacements
for OpenBSD library functions and the introduction of PAM support. This
version tracks changes made to the OpenBSD CVS version.

The PAM support is now more functional than the popular packages of
commercial ssh-1.2.x. It checks "account" and "session" modules for
all logins, not just when using password authentication. This code is
very new and needs further testing. I have also added basic libpwdb 
support (detected by autoconf).

All new code is released under a XFree style license, which is very
liberal.  This code is released with no warranties of any kind,
neither I nor my employer (Internet Business Solutions) will take any
responsibility for any loss, damage or liability arising from the use
or abuse of this software. The code in strlcpy.c and mktemp.c is from
the OpenBSD project and has its own license (see source file for 
details). 

OpenSSH depends on Zlib[1], OpenSSL[2] and optionally PAM[3].
It now uses autoconf to build thanks to Dan Brosemer <odin@linuxfreak.com>
