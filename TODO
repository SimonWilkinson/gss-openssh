- Replacement for setproctitle()

- Improve PAM support (a pam_lastlog module will cause sshd to exit)

- Better documentation

- Port to other platforms (Finish Solaris support)

- Fix paths in manpages using autoconf

- Better testing on non-PAM systems

- Replace the horror in acconfig.h which tries to comphensate for the 
  lack of u_intXX_t types. There must be a better way.
