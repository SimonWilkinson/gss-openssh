- Replacement for setproctitle()

- Improve PAM support (a pam_lastlog module will cause sshd to exit)

- Better documentation

- Replace the horror in acconfig.h which tries to comphensate for the 
  lack of u_intXX_t types. There must be a better way.

- Hanging on logout:

localhost$ ssh remotehost
remotehost$ sleep 20 &
remotehost$ logout
(ssh hangs at logout for 20 seconds)

Worse:

localhost$ ssh root@remotehost
remotehost# httpd
remotehost# logout
(ssh hangs at logout forever)
