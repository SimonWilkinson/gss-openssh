Overview:

This directory contains files to build an AIX native (installp or SMIT
installable) openssh package.


Directions:

./configure [options]
cd contrib/aix; ./buildbff.sh


Acknowledgements:

The contents of this directory are based on Ben Lindstrom's Solaris
buildpkg.sh. Ben also supplied inventory.sh.

Jim Abbey's (GPL'ed) lppbuild-2.1 was used to learn how to build .bff's
and for comparison with the output from this script, however no code
from lppbuild is included and it is not required for operation.


Other notes:

The script treats all packages as USR packages (not ROOT+USR when
appropriate).  It seems to work, though......

If there are any patches to this that have not yet been integrated they
may be found at http://www.zip.com.au/~dtucker/openssh/ or
http://home.usf.advantra.com.au/~dtucker/openssh/.


Disclaimer:

It is hoped that it is useful but there is no warranty. If it breaks
you get to keep both pieces.
