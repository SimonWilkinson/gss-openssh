README for OpenSSH Solaris packaging scripts
Rip Loomis <loomisg@saic.com> - 2000-08-02

To use, simply expand this tarball under your main
OpenSSH source directory--it will create a
contrib/solaris subdirectory.  Run configure and
make in OpenSSH as before.  Then, from either
that directory or the main OpenSSH source directory,
run the command "build-pkg" (specifying the
appropriate path of course.)  A subdirectory
will be created as contrib/solaris/build-SSH-package,
and after the build is done the package will be
present in that build-SSH-package directory
with a name of the form
OPENssh-$SSHversion-$arch-$OSversion[-$installLocation]

The build and install scripts should take into account
most possible situations (existing SSH installation,
differences in Solaris version between build and
target systems, changes you have made to the default
configuration, etc.)  I would appreciate any feedback
or comments.

Copyright information is included below, followed by the known issue list.
Both are taken verbatim from the "build-pkg" script.

#### Known issues
# These methods are generally based on a "default" compilation of
# OpenSSH on Solaris--so the more things that you change from the default,
# the greater the chance that something in the script won't be able to
# handle the changes.  In general, though, most things should be determined
# from your compile environment--the architecture, SSH version, and
# other related data should all get picked up by this script.  The script
# and data files were last updated to match OpenSSH 2.1.1p4.
#
# All building and packaging is done under a temporary directory that is
# itself created under the contrib/solaris directory--so there shouldn't
# be any special security issues (or need for root access during the
# packaging process).  The temporary directory is defined below as
# ${BUILDDIR}.
#
# The permissions on the installed files are based on how we prefer to
# do things here--so nothing is installed SetUID to root.
#
# The post-install script makes a good-faith attempt to install a
# functional configuration on your system.  I would be interested in hearing
# of any failure modes that are found, as I tried to compensate for all
# the ones that showed up here when we started replacing all the
# different installed versions of SSH.
