The following is a new package build script for Solaris.   This is being
introduced into OpenSSH 3.0 and above in hopes of simplifying the build
process.  

The build process is called a 'dummy install'.. Which means the software does
a  "make install-nokeys DESTDIR=[fakeroot]".  This way all manpages should
be handled correctly and key are defered until the first time the sshd
is started.

Directions:

1. make -F Makefile.in distprep  (Only if you are getting from the CVS tree)
2. ./configure --with-pam [..any other options you want..]
3. cd contrib/solaris; ./buildpkg.sh

If all goes well you should have a solaris package ready to be installed.

If you have any problems with this script please post them to 
openssh-unix-dev@mindrot.org and I will try to assist you as best as I can.

TODO:
- Expand to cover all sysvr4 family of OSes
- Clean things up a bit more.  
- Detect if sshd is running and refuse to start.
- SHOULD check for existing sshd_config nor ssh_config (does not currently).
  [Post install script?  Ugh.. Nasty]
